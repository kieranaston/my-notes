# Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

* Amazon EC2 is a virtual server
* **Client-server model**: Client can be a web browser or desktop app that person interacts with, server can be services such as Amazon EC2 (a virtual server)

## Deployment models

### Cloud based deployment

* Run all parts of the application in the cloud
* Migrate existing applications to the cloud
* Design and build new applications in the cloud
* Can build applications on low-level or high-level infrastructure depending on how much management you want to do yourself

**Example**: Company might create an application consisting of virtual servers, databases, and networking components that are fully based in the cloud

### On-premises deployment

* Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
* Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
* Also known as private cloud deployment

**Example**: You might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center. Incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization

### Hybrid deployment

* Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
* Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications

**Example**: You might have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises. Suppose a company wants to use cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics. However, the company has several legacy applications that are more suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud. With hybrid deployment, the company would be able to keep the legacy applications on premises while benefitting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud.

## Benefits of cloud computing

### Trade upfront expense for variable expense

* Upfront costs like data centers, physical servers, etc. gone
* Only pay for resources you consume

### Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers

* Eliminates requirement to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers

### Stop guessing capacity

* Don't have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application
* Can deploy Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) when needed, and pay only for the compute time you use

### Benefit from massive economies of scale

* Because lots of customers can aggregate in the cloud, providers, such as AWS, can achieve higher economies of scale (translates to lower prices)

### Increase speed and agility

* Flexibility, easier to develop and deploy applications
* More time to experiment and innovate (access new resources within minutes)

### Go global in minutes

Deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
