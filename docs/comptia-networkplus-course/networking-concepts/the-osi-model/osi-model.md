# The OSI Model

Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model.

## Layer 1: Physical (bottom layer)

Describes the physical signals being sent through the cables.

* Cables, fiber, and signal itself

## Layer 2: Data Link

MAC (Media Access Control) address layer. MAC address is physical address associated with network cards.

* Frame, MAC address, Extended Unique Identifier, Switch

## Layer 3: Network Layer

Looking at destination IP address to determine what next hop might be for traffic traversing the network (router doing this).

* IP Address, Router, Packet

## Layer 4: Transport Layer

Referring to the ability to transport info from one device to another.

* TCP segment, UDP datagram

## Layer 5: Session Layer

Communication management between point A and point B.

* Control protocols, tunneling protocols

## Layer 6: Presentation Layer

Putting all of this data into a format that we will eventually see with our human eyes.

* Application encryption (SSL/TLS)

## Layer 7: Application Layer (top level)

The layer we see.

* Your eyes
