# d4 openings

More strategically oriented than e4.

Generally 1 e4 is about taking initiative, while 1 e5 is about balancing the center.

## Why is e4 more direct?

This is because the course of action, most of the time, following e4 is much more obvious. Often what will happen is 1 e4 e5. e5 is the book move for black because it fights for the centre by controlling d4 and taking space.

The obvious response for white is 2 Nf3, or 2 f4. Either way white's object of attack is unambiguous.

## The more strategic d4

### 1 d4 d5 (Closed Game)

One of the two logical responses is 1 d4 d5, with the main difference of this versus e4 being that the d5 pawn is defended (unlike the e5 pawn in 1 e4 e5).

1 d4 d5 can actually lead to white being able to attac black's stronghold because of the possibility of 2 c4 (Queen's Gambit).

If black declines by protecting the panw on d5 with 2 ... e6 (Queen's Gambit Declines) or 2 ... c6 (Slav Defence), white gains space and can break with e4 later. This can be facilitated by white playing Nc3 and then e4 at some point.

If black accepts by taking the white pawn on c4 with 2 dxc4 (Queen's Gambit Accepted), white can regain the lost material with better development by playing e4 or e3 and controlling the center.

### 1 d4 Nf6 (Indian Defense)

Has the benefit of controlling e4 and prevents advance of d4 pawn.

#### 2 c4 e6

The less-thought-out line of this move would be for white to continue on with the idea of 2 c4, and for black to play 2 ... e6 in the hopes of 3 ... d5 to fight for the center. This move also opens up a diagonal for blacks bishop.

There are actually other good ways for black to proceed after 2 c4. One way is with 2 ... e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 (Nimzo-Indian Defence).

Here, instead of trying to fight for the center black opts for rapid development of their bishop. It pins the knight on c3 which had been protecting the e4 square in anticipation of white moving its pawn there. That means that white can no longer easily dominate the center.

The idea here is to give up on fighting for the center early on with pawn and instead stop white from taking any more control while developing your pieces.

Black can now castle kingside as well.

White can play a3 here to attack the bishop, but in this situation black can play 4 ... Bxc3+, forcing white to take with the b2 pawn and double up pawns on the c file.

If instead of playing 3 Nc3 white plays 3 Nf3, black has two alternatives. They can play 3 ... b6 (Queen's Indian Defence), or 3 ... Bb4+ (Borgoljubow Defence).

The idea of 3 ... b6 is to get the black bishop on b7 so that it controls the e4 and d5 squares. One piece of modern theory is piece pressure is better than pawn occupation.

The idea of 3 ... Bb4+ is that white must block the bishop and this can either transpose into a Nimzo-Indian Defence or result in an exchange of pieces.
