# Utility commands and user management

## Linux file editor

Several standard text editors on most Linux systems:

* `vi` visual editor
* `ed` standard line editor
* `ex` extended line editor
* `emacs` a full screen editor
* `pico` beginner's editor
* `vim` advanced version of vi

Will focus on `vi` because it is usually available on every Linux system and is easy to learn.

## Most common `vi` commands

`i` insert
`Esc` escape out of any mode
`r` replace
`d` delete
`:q!` quit without saving
`:wq!` quit and save

When you enter `vi` you will be in command mode. The other mode is the typing (insert) mode.

To enter typing mode you hit `i` or "insert".

To save you could shift + z z. Or you could do `:wq!`
