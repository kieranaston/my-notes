## Block storage

Bag full of bits where you can attach to something and mount your own file system on it.

Good for editing parts of a file (block level changes).

## Object storage

Stores virtual containers that encapsulate and abstract the data for you.

Interact with object storage using APIs, no data editing.

**Amazon Elastic File Service (Amazon EFS)**

**Amazon FSx**

## File storage

Block-level granularity, but do not have access to raw storage but file system.
