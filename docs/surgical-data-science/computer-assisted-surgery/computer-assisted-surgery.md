# Computer-assisted Surgery

**Image-guided surgery** is using visualizations that are images to help a surgeon perform a surgery.

**Computer-assisted surgery** is using technology somehow to improve the execution of surgery.

## How we approach an operation

In each phase of an operation, i.e., pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative we have a workflow utilizing imaging, our patient-specific model, and out computer-assisted plan.

All aspects are working dynamically and changing each other.

At the end we put everything into a database.

## System design

When desiging systems we have to consider that there are loads of different brands of equipment and software.

When designing a system it is complete with navigation software, hardware interface, and hardware.

## Challenges

Image segmentation, i.e., determining the meaningful sections of an image.

Spatial registration, i.e., determining the transformation between two coordinate frames (or images).
