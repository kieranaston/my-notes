# Surgical Data Science

> *Surgical data science aims to improve the quality of interventional healthcare and its value though capturing, organization, analysis, and modeling of data.*

**Surgery** is any physical manipulation of a tool on a patient's body.

## The Problem

More knowledge to sift through $\rightarrow$ less feasible to translate that knowledge into actionable insights.

Surgical data science can help physicians sift through data and figure out what actions to take.

## Data

Many different types from before, during, and after surgery:

* Medical images
* Navigation data
* Patient status data
* Surgeon status data
* Resource utilization
* Medical records
* Expert knowledge

## Applications

* Decision support
* Smart operating room assistant
* Data-Driven operating room scheduling
* Training
* Monitoring surgeon fatigue
* Assessing new technologies tntroduced into OR
* Identifying steps of the surgery that need improvement
* Best post-operative care plan

## Challenges

1. Cost of error
2. Accountability
3. Heterogeneity in patients, anatomy, and disease
4. Machine collaboration with clinicians

## How do we approach problems?

* What is going on?
* How well is it going?
* What is next?

This approach is enabled by time series classification.
